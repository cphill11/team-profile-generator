# Professional Team Profile Generator HTML Starter Code


## Description
Command-line application that accepts user input to generate an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the user's input.

Manager is first prompted for their information, including the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.  Then the Manager is then prompted for information for their team members, with options including both Engineer and Intern.  

Selecting Engineer prompts Manager to to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and they are then taken back to the menu. Selecting Intern prompts Manager to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and they are then taken back to the menu.

Clicking on an email address in the HTML instructs the default email program to open and populate the TO field of the email with the given email address. Clicking on a GitHub username opens that GitHub profile in a new tab. When the Manager is finished building the team, the application is exited, and an HTML is generated.
